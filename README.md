# Netlify + FaunaDB &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/netlify/netlify-faunadb-example&stack=fauna"><img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg"></a>

Example of using [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/) with [Netlify functions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/).

This example shows how to use HTTP only cookies for auth with FaunaDB's native Graphql API.

## About this application

This application is using [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the frontend, [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/) for API calls, and [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/) as the backing database, utilizing the Graphql API with [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/deployment/lambda/). This project is bundled with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

The todo editing is enabled by [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/)

This project is primarily derived from [netlify-faunadb-example](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-faunadb-example)

## Easy setup with Netlify dev

[Netlify Dev](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/) works with `parcel-bundler` out of the box!

(it also works with `create-react-app`)

So there is no need to install `netlify-lambda` and set up function proxies.

## How to Setup & Run Locally

### Get your code

1. Clone down the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/---
   ```

2. Enter the repo directory

   ```bash
   cd netlify-faunadb-example
   ```

3. Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   # -OR-
   yarn
   ```

### Prepare FaunaDB database

4. Sign up for a FaunaDB account

   https://dashboard.fauna.com/accounts/register

5. Create a master database. It will become the parent database for the app database generated by the script provided.
   In the Fauna Cloud Console:

   - Click “New Database”
   - Enter any name, e.g. “Netlify”, as the “Database Name”
   - Click “Save”

6. Create a database access key

   In the Fauna Cloud Console:

   - Click “Security” in the left navigation
   - Click “New Key”
   - Make sure that the “Database” field is set to “Netlify” (or whatever you named it)
   - Make sure that the “Role” field is set to “Admin”
   - Enter any name, e.g. “Netlify Admin key” as the “Key Name”
   - Click “Save”

7. Copy the database access key’s secret

   Save the secret somewhere safe; you won’t get a second chance to see it.

### Bootstrap the database

8. Set your database access secret for running the bootstrapping scripts
   Either set the environment variables directly in your terminal, or use a `.env` file. The scripts will pick up anything in a `.env` file.

   In your terminal, run the following command:

   ```bash
   # bash
   export FAUNADB_ADMIN_KEY="YourFaunaDBSecretHere"
   ```

   > NOTE: Make sure to replace `YourFaunaDBSecretHere` with the value of the secret that you copied in the previous step.

   > NOTE: We'll set a different variable for FAUNADB_PUBLIC_KEY in a bit, which is the important key to actually run the app!

9. Bootstrap your FaunaDB collection and indexes

   ```bash
   npm run bootstrap-db
   ```

   The `bootstrap-db` script will output some important information. Copy down the created keys shown to you in the output. If you lose the keys, you can generate them by hand or run the bootstrap command again.

   Output should be similar to:

   ```
   Creating your FaunaDB Database...

   1) Create database "netlify-auth..."
   + Created Database "aut_example".

   2) Establish keys..."
   + Created "Admin key for auth_example"
   o Using FAUNADB_APP_ADMIN_KEY: fnADl6mmyxACE_l3awMn6E0-hVWMJfsj9YEGMLcP
   + Created "Server key for auth_example"
   o Using FAUNADB_SERVER_KEY: fnADl6mm1hACEyjnsgULIdYdY8OO0wFnb6fGIcjG

   3) Create "User"...
   + Created new Collection "User".
   + Created Index "unique_User_email".

   4) Create "Todo"...
   + Created Collection "Todo"
   + Created Index "all_todos"
   + Created Index "todo_owner_by_user"

   5) Create User Defined Functions...
   + Created UDF "login"
   + Created UDF "logout"
   + Created UDF "me"
   + Created UDF "user_create_todo"

   6) Create custom roles...
   + Created Role "public"
   + Created new public client key.
   o Using FAUNADB_PUBLIC_KEY: fnADl6mnYoACE0tFKEmd6TVXhyuwdm8jVV9Zqalm
   + Created Role "user"

   Fauna Database schema has been created
   Claim your fauna database with "netlify addons:auth fauna"
   ```

10. Upload Graphql Schema

    In the Fauna Cloud Console:

    - Click “GraphQL” in the left navigation
    - Click “IMPORT SCHEMA”
    - Upload the schema at `functions/graphql/faunaSchema.graphql`

11. (Optional) Add example data

    Set the `FAUNADB_SERVER_KEY` variable (or save to `.env` file).

    Then run

    ```bash
    npm run bootstrap-example-data
    ```

    Or, use the GraphQL Playground now available in the cloud console.

### Run project Locally

12. Get `netlify-cli`

    ```bash
    npm install netlify-cli -g
    ```

13. Run the project

    ```bash
    netlify dev
    ```

## Updating the Schema

This project uses `apollo-server-lambda` for the lambda function. Lambdas are [not a great solution for fetching remote schemas](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/3190). Because of this, any time a new schema is uploaded to FaunaDB, the SDL should be downloaded and placed as a string in `functions/graphql/remoteSchema.js`.
